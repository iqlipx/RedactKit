⚠️ **Note:**<br>
The RedactKit extension is currently on the awaiting list for review by Mozilla. I am waiting for approval, so please hang tight! Once it's live, you’ll be able to enjoy it on Firefox. Thank you for your patience!

# RedactKit — Redact It All, Protect It All

**RedactKit** is a Firefox extension that helps you protect your privacy by automatically hiding sensitive or personal words on any webpage. Whether it’s your **name, email, or anything else**, RedactKit replaces those words with `[REDACTED]` in real-time, even in form fields and the browser tab title.

Perfect for **streamers** 🎮, **screen-sharers** 💻, or anyone tired of manually blurring out their personal info 🔒.


## What It Brings to the Table

- Instant redaction of chosen words on any website
- Covers everything — page text, input fields, tab titles, and more
- Keeps up with live page changes — no refresh needed
- Fully customizable word list
- Clean, simple popup interface with save + toggle buttons
- 100% local – doesn’t ping a single external server


## Real-Life Uses

- Going live? 🎥 Keep names, emails, or passwords off your stream 🚫
- Sharing your screen at work? 💼 Hide sensitive client or internal terms 📄


## Getting Started

1. Tap the **RedactKit icon** in your Firefox toolbar  
2. Drop in the words you want to block (comma-separated)  
   _Example: `email, John, confidential`_
3. Hit **💾 Save**
4. Flip the switch to turn redaction on
5. That’s it — surf as usual. We’ll handle the hiding.
