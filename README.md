# RedactKit — Because Some Words Aren’t Meant to Be Seen

**RedactKit** is a Firefox extension that helps you protect your privacy by automatically hiding sensitive or personal words on any webpage. Whether it’s your **name, email, or anything else**, RedactKit replaces those words with `[REDACTED]` in real-time, even in form fields and the browser tab title.

Ideal for streamers, screen-sharers, and anyone tired of manually blurring out their life.


## 🚀 What It Brings to the Table

- Instant redaction of chosen words on any website
- Covers everything — page text, input fields, tab titles, and more
- Keeps up with live page changes — no refresh needed
- Fully customizable word list
- Clean, simple popup interface with save + toggle buttons
- 100% local – doesn’t ping a single external server


## 🔍 Real-Life Uses

- Going live? Keep names, emails, or passwords off your stream
- Sharing your screen at work? Hide sensitive client or internal terms


## 🎛️ Getting Started

1. Tap the **RedactKit icon** in your Firefox toolbar  
2. Drop in the words you want to block (comma-separated)  
   _Example: `email, John, confidential`_
3. Hit **💾 Save**
4. Flip the switch to turn redaction on
5. That’s it — surf as usual. We’ll handle the hiding.


## 🔐 Privacy That Respects Yours

- No logs. No trackers. No cloud.  
- Everything runs locally, right in your browser  
- It’s privacy-enhancing — not privacy-invasive


## 💬 Pro Tip

Need to tweak your list? Just open the extension, update your keywords, and save — changes go live instantly.
