# RedactKit â€” Redact It All, Protect It All

**RedactKit** is a Firefox extension that helps you protect your privacy by automatically hiding sensitive or personal words on any webpage. Whether itâ€™s your **name, email, or anything else**, RedactKit replaces those words with `[REDACTED]` in real-time, even in form fields and the browser tab title.

Perfect for **streamers** ðŸŽ®, **screen-sharers** ðŸ’», or anyone tired of manually blurring out their personal info ðŸ”’.


## What It Brings to the Table

- Instant redaction of chosen words on any website
- Covers everything â€” page text, input fields, tab titles, and more
- Keeps up with live page changes â€” no refresh needed
- Fully customizable word list
- Clean, simple popup interface with save + toggle buttons
- 100% local â€“ doesnâ€™t ping a single external server


## Real-Life Uses

- Going live? ðŸŽ¥ Keep names, emails, or passwords off your stream ðŸš«
- Sharing your screen at work? ðŸ’¼ Hide sensitive client or internal terms ðŸ“„
